## Short description and usage

[Vue Paper Dashboard](https://github.com/cristijora/vue-paper-dashboard) is a beautiful resource built over Bootstrap and Vue. It will help you get started developing dashboards in no time. Vue Paper Dashboard is a Vue ported version of the [Original Paper Dashboard](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/paper-dashboard).
Using the Dashboard is pretty simple but requires basic knowledge of Javascript, [Vue](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) and [Vue-Router](https://router.vuejs.org/en/).

Vue Paper Dashboard was coded by [Cristi Jora](https://github.com/cristijora) and the design was made by [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/?ref=pdf-vuejs-doc).

## Getting started

Vue Paper Dashboard is built on top of Bootstrap 3, Vue and Vue-router.
To get started do the following steps:

1. Clone or download the [Project](https://github.com/cristijora/vue-paper-dashboard)
2. Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
3. Type `npm install` in the source folder where `package.json` is located
4. Type `npm run dev` to start the development server

The repo uses [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) scaffolding which takes care
of the development setup with webpack and all the necessary modern tools to make web development faster and easier.

#### Npm tasks:
- `npm run dev` - starts a development server on `localhost:8080` with live-reload
- `npm run build` - builds the app for production with javascript minification and versioning
- `npm run unit` - Runs unit tests located under `test\unit` folder. There are couple of tests written for you to get a better idea on how to run and write Vue unit tests
- `npm run unit:watch` - Runs unit tests while listening for any changes in the project. This way you can develop new features and make sure that your old components work as expected without running unit tests every time.
- `npm run e2e` - Runs end to end tests. The command and the setup for end to end tests is provided by vue-cli. If you need and have the necessity to write end to end tests, feel free to write them under `test\e2e` folder
- `npm run test` - Runs both unit and end to end tests.
